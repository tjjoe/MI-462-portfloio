# Data Analytics Portfolio  
Hello. My name is Terry J Augustine and I am a 2022 graduate of DeSales University. I have my bachelors degree in computer science with a dual minor in mathematics and data analytics. I am currently searching for a career with a strong company in data analytics. I completed work on a project basis for Thread Bioscience Inc. that included work in SQL, Python, Tableau, and various other programs. Unfortunately I cannot show that work due to both Hippa laws and intellecual property belonging to them. This is my portfolio that includes deliverables for all of the classes involved in the DeSales Data Analytics minor.
